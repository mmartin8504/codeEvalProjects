To be a cluster, each user must have an incoming and outgoing communication
with each other user in the cluster (ie. every permutation of users
communicated with each other).

This should just mean that I need to make a graph of all users' communications
and then find all the subgraphs that form clusters.

Such graphs are called permutation graphs.

A naive approach may be just to do some sort of DFS/BFS from each node to find
all the other nodes are connected, but that seems like it will be slow AF.

Theoretically you can test if a graph is a permutation graph in linear time, but
I would have to test every sub-graph, which would probably mean n! number of linear
tests.

It would probably be adventageous for my graph to be sorted since the results need
to be sorted. I should also be able to elimiate some amount of testing based on
the fact that things are sorted.

After reading about cliques and complete graphs/digraphs, they have special properties
that can be tested for. A graph is a complete digraph if it has an edge going to/from
each node to every other node, which is exactly the kind of graphs I'm looking for.
That means that each vertex should have 2(n-1) edges and the whole graph will have
n(n-1) edges. Using these properties, I should be able to tell what the max number of
nodes there can be in a graph with a given node in it simply based on the number of edges
it has. Still not sure how I'm going to use that to find ALL the cliques of size N>=3.
